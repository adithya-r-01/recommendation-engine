</h1>

> A project built on top of `Java` frameworks utilizing User-Based collabarative filtering techniques. This project specifically utilizes Manhattan Distance to create efficient recommendations.

## Requirements
 
This project is built with `Java` and utilizes Apache Maven. Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information (the `pom.xml` file). 

`Java` Requirements:

```bash
openjdk version "15.0.2" 2021-01-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 15.0.2+7-27)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 15.0.2+7-27, mixed mode, sharing)
```

`Maven` Requirements:

```bash
Apache Maven 3.6.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)
Maven home: /Users/adithya/Downloads/apache-maven-3.6.3
Java version: 15.0.2, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-15.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.16", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

## File Structure

`.idea` - A folder specific to my IDE (ignore)

`src` - Source code directory

`target` - Compiler output (ignore)

`gitattributes` - Ignore

`dataset.csv` - The dataset which is a csv file created by python script reading a mySQL table

`pom.xml` - Maven specfic file (ignore)

## Configuration Options

`driver.java` has the main method which runs the program. The configuration option are as follows:

```java
// The first parameter in the ThresholdUserNeighborhood constructor is the similarity threshold
UserNeighborhood neighborhood = new ThresholdUserNeighborhood(0.0,similarity, model);
```

```java
// The First argument is the userID and the Second parameter is 'HOW MANY'
List<RecommendedItem> recommendations = recommender.recommend(2, 2);
```

### User-Based Recommendation

To leverage these three parameters use the command line interface. The first parameter is the threshold, the second parameter is the user_id, and the third parameter is the count:

```bash
java Driver 0.0 2 2
```

### Popularity Recommendation

Sometimes it becomes neccesary to get the top N popular prompts. To request this via the CLI the first paramater is the threshold and the second parameter is the count:

```bash
java Driver 0.0 1
```


The output will be printed to the system in the form of:

```bash
RecommendedItem[item:12, value:4.857143]
RecommendedItem[item:14, value:3.357143]
```
